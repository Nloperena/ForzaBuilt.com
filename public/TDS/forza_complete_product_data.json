Fiberglass material should hold in place.\n• Build up composite material and allow to cure normally (preferably overnight).\n• Continue with vacuum infusion process; the adhesive will aid the flow of resin through the materials and will become part of the composite.\n• Remove the composite from the mold.\n• Recommended operating temperatures range from 60°F to 100°F. Canister system should be kept in warm area. In the event that the canister gets abnormally chilled, freezes or gives poor or sputtering spray, it should be warmed up before continued usage. Warming canister by immersion in warm water is recommended.\n• Notice!!! Do not store at temperatures over 120º F.",

Fiberglass material should hold in place.\n• Build up composite material and allow to cure normally (preferably overnight).\n• Continue with vacuum infusion process; the adhesive will aid the flow of resin through the materials and will become part of the composite.\n• Remove the composite from the mold.\n• Recommended operating temperatures range from 60°F to 100°F. Canister system should be kept in warm area. In the event that the canister gets abnormally chilled, freezes or gives poor or sputtering spray, it should be warmed up before continued usage. Warming canister by immersion in warm water is recommended.\n• Notice!!! Do not store at temperatures over 120º F.",

    "how_to_use": "• ForzaBOND® TC467 is designed as a portable, self-contained spray system for field or shop applications.\n• Apply adhesive to one or both surfaces to be mated, at 80% to 100% coverage. Spraying both surfaces will result in a stronger, more permanent bond.\n• Allow enough time (2-4 minutes or until dry to the touch) for the adhesive to become tacky before bonding.\n• Parts should be mated with as much pressure as practical. Normal coverage required with web spray pattern is approximately 80% however, porous surfaces may need a second coat.\n• Initial bond is strong enough to allow cutting or trimming immediately, although ultimate strength is achieved in 1-3 days.",
