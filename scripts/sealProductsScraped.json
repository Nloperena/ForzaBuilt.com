      "It may be used to adhere all engineered, solid, bamboo, cork, and parquet.",
      "It may be used over all properly prepared substrates common to hardwood flooring installations including; concrete, plywood, OSB, well bonded vinyl/VCT and ceramic tile, cement backer board, gypsum underlayments (dry, above grade), cement patch/underlayments, radiant-heat flooring, and properly prepared terrazzo.",

Re-trowel 90° to the ridges, and if no sign of the original trowel marks remains, install additional flooring and check coverage and transfer.",
      "Adhesive that has cured too much prior to installation of the flooring must be mechanically removed and fresh adhesive applied.",

      "Using a recommended trowel, apply adhesive/membrane to substrate and then set plywood into the wet adhesive/membrane.",
      "For moisture protection, ensure 100% coverage and transfer.",

See the chart on last page for proper trowel selection.Flooring is to be installed using a “Wet-Lay” method of installation.For a “Wet-Lay” type of installation, spread the adhesive and begin to install the flooring immediately.Periodically lift boards immediately after installation to ensure proper slab coverage and transfer to the back of the flooring. If a thin skin forms on the adhesive on the slab prior to installation of the flooring, it may be possible to re-trowel the adhesive and obtain proper coverage and transfer. Re-trowel 90° to the ridges, and if no sign of the original trowel marks remains, install additional flooring and check coverage and transfer.Adhesive that has cured too much prior to installation of the flooring must be mechanically removed and fresh adhesive applied.Although it is relatively easy to remove OA75 adhesive from the face of prefinished hardwood even after cure, it is recommended to clean with a non-abrasive towel as you work prior to cure.After a few rows have been installed, and as you move across the room, tape the boards together using removable 3M #2080 Blue tape to prevent boards from sliding and to secure close-fitting joints.Flooring that is not flat should be tacked, weighted, or rolled to ensure proper contact between the flooring and substrate. Plywood Over Concrete:Score 4′ x 4′ or 2′ x 8′ sheets of 3/4″ exterior-grade plywood on the backside every 8″ to 10″ by using a circular saw and cutting onehalf the thickness of the plywood; “scoring or kerfing” takes the tension out of the plywood and helps to prevent possible warping or curling.Using a recommended trowel, apply adhesive/membrane to substrate and then set plywood into the wet adhesive/membrane.For moisture protection, ensure 100% coverage and transfer.Allow the adhesive/membrane to fully cure before nailing or using OA75 adhesive/ membrane to install flooring.Make sure that nails do not penetrate through the OA75 membrane.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSizing\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4 Gallon Pail",

When bonding metals, applying OSA Surface Activator to area to be bonded is recommended for best results. Apply between 34º -150 º F, in damp or dry conditions. The majority of its strength is developed in the first 24 hours. Minimum cure time is overnight, but several days may be required for maximum performance, however cure time may be accelerated at higher temperatures (do not exceed 150º F for accelerated cure). Most parts do not require fixturing, although heavy parts may require temporary fixturing to ensure desired positioning.

Hold parts in position while curing (pressure clamping is not required).At room temperature handling strength is achieved at 7-10 minutes and full cure in 2-3 hours.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSizing\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t50 ml Cartridge400 ml Cartridge5 Gallon52 Gallon Drum",

Brush, caulk, pump or trowell OS37 on all duct seams. Apply to applied flange corners. Apply to all penetrations in the duct wall including sheet metal screw heads and tie rods. When caulking, sealant should be brushed into seams. For round and oval spiral duct. Apply a 2-inch band around outside of joint, covering all screws. For rigid fiberglass air duct: Assemble sections according to the manufacturers recommendations. Apply a 3-inch by 20 mil band to the joint. Embed a fiberglass scrim (5 mil, 20 x 10 plain weave, 1.75 oz per sq. yd.) in the sealant and apply another 20 mil coat over the scrim.Since temperature and humidity conditions may vary, longer cure. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSizing\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t650 ml Aerosol22L Canister108L Canister",

Meets U.L. 746C (File E 122798) and 723, Class “L” low flammability rating (File R 7311).Forza aluminum foil tape 425 can be certified to meet L-T-80C.Meets requirements of FAR 25.853(a).The very low moisture vapor transmission rate makes these tapes a good sealant.The acrylic adhesive, combined with the durable aluminum backing, offers ideal properties for long serviceable life in and outdoors.Good candidate as a maskant in electroplating of aluminum because it will not contaminate the bath.Aluminum backing provides excellent reflection of both heat and light.Best results obtained when applied to a clean, dry surface above 32°F (0°C).IMPORTANT: These tapes are not intended for medical usage.
