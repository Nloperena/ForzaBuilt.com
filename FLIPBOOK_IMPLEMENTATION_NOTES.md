# Flipbook Implementation Notes

## Implementation Complete ✓

The PDF flipbook viewer has been successfully rebuilt using the `page-flip` library with modern React architecture and performance optimizations.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Library Installation
- **Package**: `page-flip` (not `st-page-flip` - that was a naming confusion)
- **NPM Command**: `npm install page-flip`
- **Version**: Latest stable from npm registry

### 2. Component Architecture

Created `src/components/BookViewerV2/` with the following structure:

```
BookViewerV2/
├── FlipbookViewer.tsx      # Top-level: PDF loading, mode switching, controls
├── FlipbookCore.tsx        # page-flip integration, virtualization logic
├── MemoizedPdfPage.tsx     # Optimized PDF page renderer (React.memo)
├── BookControls.tsx        # Navigation bar with slider and zoom button
├── ZoomedPageViewer.tsx    # 2D zoom mode with text selection
└── index.ts                # Clean exports
```

### 3. Key Features

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Virtualization**: Only renders 4-6 pages at a time (current spread + preload)
- **React.memo**: Prevents expensive canvas re-renders
- **useMemo**: Optimized page calculation
- **Lazy Loading**: Pages outside viewport are empty placeholders

#### Dual-Mode Rendering
- **Flip Mode** (3D):
  - `renderTextLayer={false}` - Maximum performance
  - `renderAnnotationLayer={false}` - Reduce DOM overhead
  - Interactive page flip animations
  
- **Zoom Mode** (2D):
  - `renderTextLayer={true}` - Enable text selection
  - `renderAnnotationLayer={true}` - Full accessibility
  - Scrollable high-resolution view
  - Independent zoom controls (75% - 300%)

#### Navigation
- Arrow keys (left/right)
- Space/Enter for next page
- Page slider with live preview
- Previous/Next buttons
- Direct page jump
- Escape to close (or exit zoom)

### 4. Integration

Updated `src/components/LibrarySection.tsx` to use new `FlipbookViewer` instead of old `BookViewer`.

### 5. Styling

Added flipbook-specific CSS to `src/index.css`:
- Container layout
- Page styling
- Canvas rendering optimization
- Hover effects
- Shadow transitions

**Note**: Removed old custom shadows (shadow-2xl, radial gradients, spine effects) to avoid conflicts with page-flip's built-in 3D effects.

## Testing Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Load PDF (test with all 6 brochures)
- [ ] Flip forward/backward (smooth, no white flash)
- [ ] Page slider scrubbing
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (arrows, space, escape)
- [ ] Page counter displays correctly (e.g., "1-2 of 32")

### Zoom Mode
- [ ] Click "Zoom to Read" button
- [ ] Zoom in/out buttons work
- [ ] Text selection works in zoom mode
- [ ] Exit zoom returns to correct page in flip mode
- [ ] Scroll works in zoom mode

### Performance
- [ ] 32-page PDF loads without memory issues
- [ ] No stuttering during flips
- [ ] No "Transport destroyed" errors in console
- [ ] Fast page changes (no lag)

### UI/UX
- [ ] Book animation (pulling → opening → reading) still works
- [ ] Close button works
- [ ] Download button works
- [ ] Open in new tab button works
- [ ] Responsive on mobile (should show single page)

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Single page PDFs (no flip, just display)
- [ ] Odd number of pages (last page alone)
- [ ] First page (can't go back)
- [ ] Last page (can't go forward)

## Known Differences from Old Implementation

### Removed Custom Effects
The old `BookSpread` component had:
- Custom shadow-2xl
- Radial gradient shadow underneath
- Manual spine gradient with inset shadow
- Corner curl hints on hover

**New approach**: Let `page-flip` library handle all 3D effects, shadows, and curls. This is cleaner and more performant.

### New Features
- Proper virtualization (old version preloaded 20 pages)
- Zoom mode with text selection
- Better mobile support (library handles touch gestures)
- Cleaner separation of concerns

## Cleanup Phase (Not Yet Done)

Once testing is complete, execute cleanup:

1. **Delete old components**:
   - `src/components/BookViewer/BookViewer.tsx`
   - `src/components/BookViewer/BookSpread.tsx`
   - `src/components/BookViewer/BookPage.tsx`
   
2. **Keep/Already Adapted**:
   - `src/components/BookViewer/BookControls.tsx` → New version in V2

3. **Rename** (after confirming everything works):
   - Rename `BookViewerV2/` to `BookViewer/`
   - Update import in `LibrarySection.tsx`

## Potential Issues to Watch

### Page-flip Library Configuration
- If pages don't flip, check that all pages have `className="page"` and correct dimensions
- If 3D effect looks wrong, adjust `width`, `height`, and `flippingTime` in `FlipbookCore.tsx`

### PDF Worker
- Uses unpkg CDN for pdf.worker.min.mjs
- If offline or CDN fails, consider bundling worker locally

### Keyboard Conflicts
- FlipbookCore captures arrow keys - ensure no conflicts with other components
- Zoom mode also uses arrow keys for navigation

### Memory Management
- page-flip requires all pages in DOM (even if empty)
- Virtualization helps, but very large PDFs (100+ pages) may need adjustment

## Files Modified

## Dev Server

The development server has been started and should be running on the default Vite port (usually http://localhost:5173).
