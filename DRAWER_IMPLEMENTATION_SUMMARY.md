# PDF Viewer Drawer Implementation

## Overview

Successfully transformed the PDF flipbook viewer from a modal popup into a smooth drawer that slides up from the bottom of the page.

## Key Changes

### 1. Drawer Animation

**Before:** Modal scales in from center with opacity fade  
**After:** Drawer slides up from bottom with spring physics

```typescript
// Old animation
initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }}
animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
exit={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }}

// New drawer animation
initial={{ y: '100%' }}
animate={{ y: 0 }}
exit={{ y: '100%' }}
transition={{ 
  type: 'spring',
  damping: 30,
  stiffness: 300,
  mass: 0.8,
}}
```

### 2. Drawer Positioning

**Layout:**
- Fixed to bottom: `bottom-0`
- Extends from left to right: `inset-x-0`
- Leaves small gap at top: `top-12 md:top-16` (allows peek of background)
- Rounded top corners: `rounded-t-3xl`
- No bottom border for seamless connection

### 3. Removed Janky Book Animation

**Eliminated:**
- `pulling` state (book rotating 90 degrees)
- `opening` state (book rotating 180 degrees and scaling)
- Animated book cover element
- Complex animation variants

**Result:**
- Click book â†’ Drawer slides up immediately
- Clean, fast, professional transition
- No janky multi-stage animations

### 4. Drawer Handle Indicator

Added visual cue at top of drawer:
- Small white rounded pill: `w-12 h-1`
- Semi-transparent: `bg-white/30`
- Centered at top
- Indicates drawer can be dismissed (familiar mobile pattern)

### 5. Backdrop Update

**Changes:**
- Lighter backdrop: `bg-black/70` (was `bg-black/90`)
- Allows more of the page to show through
- Draws focus to the drawer sliding up
- Click backdrop to close drawer

### 6. Minimized Controls

**Top Bar:**
- Compact height (~40px vs ~72px)
- Small icons (3.5 size)
- Title only (no subtitle)
- Glassmorphic styling

**Bottom Bar:**
- Minimal controls (~48px vs ~120px)
- Icon-only buttons
- Compact page counter: `1-2 / 32`
- No slider (click areas work better)

**Zoom Button:**
- Small icon button
- Glassmorphic floating style
- Positioned near bottom controls

## Design Benefits

âœ… **Consistent** - Same drawer animation for zoom mode  
âœ… **Visual feedback** - Drawer handle shows it's dismissible  

## Technical Details

### Animation Timing
- Spring animation: Natural, physics-based motion
- Damping: 30 (smooth deceleration)
- Stiffness: 300 (responsive)
- Mass: 0.8 (lightweight feel)

### Glassmorphic Effects
- Background: Blue gradient at 98% opacity
- Backdrop blur: 20px for depth
- Border: Subtle white (15% opacity)
- Controls: Nested blur effects

### Z-Index Hierarchy
- Backdrop: `z-[9998]`
- Drawer: `z-[9999]`
- Zoom mode: `z-[10001]` (overlays drawer)
