/**
 * ServiceCardStack Component
 * 
 * A reusable, data-driven component that creates a stack of service cards with scroll-based animations.
 * This component has been refactored to be more maintainable by delegating specific responsibilities
 * to focused hooks and components.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Scroll-based stacking animation
 * - Dynamic card generation from data
 * - Self-contained scroll calculations
 * - Responsive to viewport changes
 * - CMS-ready data structure
 * 
 * Architecture:
 * - Uses useScrollCalculator hook for scroll logic
 * - Uses CardStackItem components for individual card rendering
 * - Uses StackSpacer component for scroll height management
