# BookViewerV2 - page-flip Implementation

## Status: Debugging

The flipbook viewer implementation is complete, but there's an issue where the book never loads in.

## Recent Fix Applied

Fixed the initialization race condition where `page-flip` was trying to load pages before the DOM elements existed.

### Changes Made to FlipbookCore.tsx:

1. Added retry logic: The initialization now waits for `.page` elements to exist before calling `pageFlipInstance.loadFromHTML()`
2. Added retry mechanism: If pages aren't ready, it waits 100ms and tries again
3. Added console logging: Debug logs when initialization succeeds

## How to Test

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Click on any brochure in the Resource Library
3. Look for these console messages:
   - "PageFlip initialized successfully with X pages" - Success!
   - "Failed to initialize PageFlip:" - Error with details
   - No message means pages aren't being created properly

## Possible Issues

### Issue 1: Pages never render
If you see no ".page" elements in the DOM:
- Check if `numPages > 0` in FlipbookCore
- Check if `pageWidth > 0` (responsive calculation working)
- Verify the Document component loaded successfully

### Issue 2: Page-flip fails to initialize
If you see initialization error:
- Check page-flip library version
- Verify all required props are being passed
- Check browser compatibility

### Issue 3: Infinite retry loop
If the page keeps retrying initialization:
- Pages might be rendering but with wrong className
- Check React DevTools to see component state
- Verify PDF is actually loading

## Debug Commands

Open browser console and run:

```javascript
// Check if page-flip instance exists
window.__flipbookAPI

// Check if pages exist in DOM
document.querySelectorAll('.page').length

// Check container ref
document.querySelector('.flipbook-container')
```

## Next Steps

Once this is working, the book should:
1. Display all pages with flip animation
2. Allow keyboard navigation (arrows, space)
3. Allow clicking pages to flip
4. Show zoom button that switches to 2D mode
5. Enable text selection in zoom mode
