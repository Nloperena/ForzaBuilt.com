It is generally applied directly from the bottle to the substrate in bead form, and bonding will be instant, reaching handling strength in about 8 seconds. Full cure is reached in 24 to 48 hours.</p><p>This industrial strength instant adhesive has high <a href=\"https://forzabuilt.com/blog/adhesive-strength-test-terms/\">tensile strength</a>, absorbs drops and impact, and is resistant to cold temperatures, moisture and most chemicals. With its high viscosity gel formula, CA GEL is gap-filling and doesn’t run, allowing for a more accurate application. It sets quickly without clamping, and dries clear, allowing for an almost invisible bond line.</p><p>Forzabond CA GEL is designed to bond a wide variety of similar and dissimilar substrates, but can be used basically anywhere! It is especially good for applications that require faster cure or resistance against gravity, or for applications that contain vertical surfaces, small gaps, dry parts or acidic parts. It bonds many substrates including ABS, acrylic, aluminum, bakelite, brass, ceramic, chloroprene, chrome, copper, EPDM, fiberglass, glass latex, leather, natural rubber, wood, NBR, neoprene, nitrile rubber, nylon, paper, phenolic, polycarbonate, polyester, polystyrene, polyurethane, porcelain, PVC, SBR, steel, stone, valox, vinyl and wood. When bonding porous substrates, CA GEL works faster and holds more strongly than regular cyanoacrylates.</p><p>Curious to know where you can use Forzabond CA GEL in your application, or just curious to learn more about the adhesive? <a href=\"https://forzabuilt.com/contact-us/\">Contact us</a>, we would love to chat about instant adhesives with you!</p>"
